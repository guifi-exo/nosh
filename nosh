# Why don't you write your own login-shell? It would be quite simple to use Bash for this, but you can use any language.
# Example in Bash
# Use your favorite editor to create the file /root/rbash.sh (this can be any name or path, but should be chown root:root and chmod 700):
# All you have to do is set this executable as your login shell. For example, edit your /etc/passwd file, and replace your current login shell of that user /bin/bash with /root/rbash.sh.
# This is just a simple example, but you can make it as advanced as you want, the idea is there. Be careful to not lock yourself out by changing login shell of your own and only user. And always test weird symbols and commands to see if it is actually secure.
# You can test it with: su -s /root/rbash.sh.
# Beware, make sure to match the whole command, and be careful with wildcards! Better exclude Bash-symbols such as ;, &, &&, ||, $, and backticks to be sure.
# Depending on the freedom you give the user, it won't get much safer than this. I've found that often I only needed to make a user that has access to only a few relevant commands, and in that case this is really the better solution. However, do you wish to give more freedom, a jail and permissions might be more appropriate. Mistakes are easily made, and only noticed when it's already too late.
